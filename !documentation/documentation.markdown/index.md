Describe is a domain specific language used to write and maintain complex data lists that are compiled on demand to different languages, like html, xml, xaml, sql or json. Describe is simple to use, intuitive and easy to master, and readily extendable.

Second-brain apps and some websites are some of the use cases, although anything that someone would rather think about in terms of lists is a good candidate.<br><br>
