_FEATURE: NLComment decorator_

The ```{nlcomment}``` decorator combines the ```{empty}``` and the ```{comment}``` decorators at one, producing a comment on a new line.

<span style="color:blue">Code has been implemented.</span>

However, it may be appropriate for this decorator to be translated an such only when the item it decorates is not the first item in the list, as the new line will probably be undesired before the first element in a list.
