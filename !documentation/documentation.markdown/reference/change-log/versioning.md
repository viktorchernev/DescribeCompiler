## history
First, a simple and rudimentary mock application was hacked together, that was called "Test Gadget". It had no real parser engine and used simple logic. In time it grew in complexity and became the Describe Compiler. Below is the source code, as a curiosity.
* [TestGadget v3](/test-gadget/test-gadget-v3)
* [TestGadget v4](/test-gadget/test-gadget-v4)
* [TestGadget v4.1](/test-gadget/test-gadget-v41)
* [TestGadget v5](/test-gadget/test-gadget-v5)
* [TestGadget v6](/test-gadget/test-gadget-v6)
* [TestGadget v6.1](/test-gadget/test-gadget-v61)
