This list explains the contents of the basic test files for Describe version 0.7 "Tags".
The strategy used here is to use some of the test files for the previous Describe version 0.6, which version 0.7 should pass as well in order to prove backward compatibility and add tags to those files. 


A. Basics

	This is about testing basic functionality in subtle variations - how the operators and whitespaces are handled and such.
	These are the same test files for Describe version 0.6, but with tags.

	A_basic1.ds - We want to test a simple Describe list to start with, with tags.
	A_basic2.ds - Same thing, but we have one element in the list, with tags.
	A_basic3.ds - Same as before, but we have said one element on the same line as the title item, with tags.
	A_basic4.ds - Same as basic1.ds, but the indent is 4 spaces, instead of tab, with tags with no spaces.
	A_basic5.ds - Same as basic1.ds, but the indent is 4 spaces, instead of tab, with tags with no spaces, and double new lines.
	A_twoRoots.ds - Two simple lists, with 4 spaces as indent, with tags.


B. Comments

	This section, of course, is about testing comments integration - line comments, block comments and issues
	that might arise from nested comments, operators in comments, etc. These are the same test files for Describe version 0.6, but with tags.
	
	B_comments1.ds - This file contains a simple line comment, with tags.
	B_comments2.ds - This file contains the same line comment like before, but also a block comment, with tag in block comment.
	B_comments3.ds - Line and 2 block comments here, but block comments hide some functionality, with tags.
	B_comments4.ds - Two line comments, but file ends with a comment and tags. This is problematic for GOLD.
	B_comments5.ds - Almost the same as `B_comments4.ds`, but the last comment is sticked to the last terminator.


C. Empty

	This section tests empty lists. Empty lists should be transpiled like they are single items, because they
	are just an item with a placeholder for a list.
	
	C_empty1.ds - A basic single empty production, with a tag.
	C_empty2.ds - Same, but without white spaces.
	C_empty3.ds - Same but with more white space.
	C_empty4.ds - Same but with more white space in the form of a new line.


D. Characters

	Those files are testing strange escape sequences, strange characters, and characters that are part of
	other tokens - line '-', '\' and '/'.
	
	D_double_characters1.ds - This file contains hyphens, as those are a part of the producer `->`. 
	Also, the file contains tags that contain hyphens.
	
	D_double_characters2.ds - This file contains forward slashes, as those are a part of the comment starts `//`.
	Also, the file contains tags that contain forward slashes.
	
	D_double_characters3.ds - This file contains backslashes, as those are a part of escape sequences `\\`, `\->`, etc.
	Also, the file contains tags that contain backslashes.
	
	D_escaped_double_characters1.ds - Escaped producers are tested here.
	Also, the file contains tags that contain escaped producers. Last tags end is interesting as well.
	
	D_escaped_double_characters2.ds - Various escape sequences are being tested here.
	Also, the file contains tags that contain various escape sequences.
	
	D_escaped_double_characters3.ds - Escape-escape symbols `\\` are being tested.
	Also, the file contains tags that contain escape-escape symbols.
	
	D_cyrillic.ds - A cyrilic list to test the handling of cyrilic characters and cyrilic tags.


E. Whitespaces

	Files in this group are testing for problems with whitespace handling. 
	Those are same as the ones for version 0.6, but contain tags that also contain escape sequences.
	
	E_spaces_escapes_N.ds - This file contains a list with some escape sequences and various types of whitespaces. Linux line endings - `\n`.
	E_spaces_escapes_RN.ds - Same as above, but line endings are windows line endings - `\r\n`.


F. Productins

	The files in this group test different variations of nested and sibling productions - expressions inside expressions, etc.
	Those are same as the ones for version 0.6, but contain tags.
	
	F_production_in_production1.ds - Simple nested production. The nested production is the first element.
	F_production_in_production2.ds - Simple nested production. The nested production is the last element.
	F_production_in_production3.ds - Simple nested production. The nested production is the middle element.
	F_production_in_production4.ds - Two simple nested productions. The nested production are first and second.
	F_production_in_production5.ds - Two simple nested productions. The nested production are last and second to last.
	F_production_in_production6.ds - Two levels of nesting.
	F_production_in_production7.ds - Two levels of nesting, both nested in the end of the file.



	//want to test a -> /* jsjsj */ ; or a -> /* jsjsj *//* jsjsj */ ; - will this create empty item from space only?
