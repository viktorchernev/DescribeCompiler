FEATURE: Optional sockets

This is in the translator classes, which are now separated from the compiler itself. Optional sockets are sockets that might not be present in the templates without producing an error and stopping up the translation process.
In both the inbuilt translators the following optional sockets have been added:

{TIME_STAMP}
{SHORT_TIME_STAMP}

{VERSION}
{SHORT_VERSION}
